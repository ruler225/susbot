# Susbot

Just a fun little discord bot I felt like making. If you would like to run it for your own bot, you'll need to do the following:
* Create a new bot using the Discord Developer Portal
* Note down your bot's token
* Create a new `config.json` file and add the following:

```javascript
{
	"BOT_TOKEN": "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"

}
```

Next, you'll need to install the proper package dependencies by running `npm install`. Once you've done that, you should be able to run the bot using the following command (assuming that you have properly set up node):
```
node index.js
```

Have fun!
